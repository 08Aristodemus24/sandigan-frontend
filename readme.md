# **Still In Production** 

# Usage:
1. clone repository with `git clone https://github.com/08Aristodemus24/sandigan-backend.git`
2. navigate to directory with `/src` directory and `package.json` file inside
3. run `npm install`
4. once node_modules is created meaning our packages and dependencies are installed run `npm run` to run react application locally on port 8080

optional:
1. run `npm run build` to create `bundle.js` and `index.html` file where we can integrate it in our server side code e.g. Django

# A client side web application where it can interact with the sandigan-backend API that already has phil-jurisprudence-recsys integrated to it.
